    "introduction": "Cyber security is recognized as an emerging subject as per AICTE (https://www.aicte-india.org/sites/default/files/UG_Emerging.pdf), and the network security lab is a critical component of the same. Currently there are no virtual labs for network security. The closest existing Vlabs have exercises focused on cryptography (https://cse29-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/ and http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/vlab_bootcamp/bootcamp/Byte_Karma/index.html). The proposed lab also focuses on the network security concepts as per the units II and III of the Cyber Security Model Curriculum. <br> The purpose of this lab is to create a better understanding of the network security concepts. This lab covers network security concepts, practices, protocols and standards, firewalls and wireless security mechanisms. This lab helps the student to gain insight into the key aspects of secure network communication and enables them to apply in real-life scenarios.",

    "objective": "The Network Security Lab virtual lab allows for preparing the student with greater confidence about the fundamentals of network security. This confidence will help the student understand the fundamentals better and aid in applying the same in a real-world scenario. The interactive simulations in the Network Security Lab play a significant role in enhancing learning. They provide visual representations of complex network security concepts, such as TCP communication, SYN Flood attacks, eavesdropping, Kerberos authentication, SSL transmission, and firewall mechanisms. The pictorial and step-by-step simulation flows help students understand the internal workings of protocols and attacks more intuitively than static text or diagrams. The interactive setup of simulations allows students to engage with the content actively, promoting better retention and comprehension. Enhancing interactivity could include adding guided walkthroughs, tooltips, real-time feedback, and interactive quizzes embedded within the simulations.",
